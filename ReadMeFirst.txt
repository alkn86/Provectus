Used packages :
CGI
DBI
CGI::Session
LWP::Simple
Digest::MD5

For using login.cgi and  viewer.cgi scripts you shoud have database with these connection parameters:
Database name : customers
Login: root
Password: PerlStudent

Then, before using CGI scripts, execute 'create_table.pl' at first. It will create new `customer` table in customers DB. After that 
you can use a scripts.

Thank you!
